## Overview & Purpose:
- This is a Dining Menu Widget built in OneStThomas, that displays the current menu for dining locations around the campus, like The View and Northsider
- This Widget has multiple  variants:
	1. Dining Menu Now (displays the menu in multiple dining locations at once)
	2. View Menu Today (displays the menu at The View for the entire day of today)
	3. Northsider Menu Today (displays ...)
- The main purpose of this widget is to make it so that students and staff have one less place to look to get their dining menu information
	- It saves time for people to search "St Thomas Menu View", click through multiple links and buttons, and then finally scroll down to see the relevant parts of the menu. It's just there in front of you in OneStThomas in 0 clicks.

## Steps Involved in Making the Widget:
1. Create a nodejs/expressjs server to handle scraping & API handling
2. Adapting the server to be hosted on AWS (This is what UST uses as a preferred cloud provider)
